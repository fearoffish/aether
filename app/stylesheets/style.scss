// First, set some default constants
@import "partials/base";

// Then we'll import the compass extension
@import "html5-boilerplate";

// If you don't require any customization
// you can choose to include the whole
// enchilada by uncommeting this line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the
// sections you want to include
@include html5-boilerplate-reset;
@include html5-boilerplate-fonts;
@include html5-boilerplate-styles;
@include html5-boilerplate-helpers;

// Or else, you can import this partial if you
// want more control over which mixins to use
//@import "partials/example";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import "partials/fonts";
@import "partials/page";

// Media should come last
@import "partials/media";
